# Ghoul

Gdscript Haskell Opinionated Unusual Linter

This is a linting/style enforcing program written in Haskell, mainly for my own personal use, and therefore it is opinionated on how code should be written.

## Project outline:

- [x] Write a Tokenizer
- [ ] Write static type checking rules
- [ ] Consider adding more rules in the future
- [ ] Adding pretty show
- [ ] Rewriting parser/tokenizer with more conventional tools (Such as Parsec)
- [ ] Refactor/Rewrite analyser (after rewriting parser/tokenizer)
- [ ] Add configuration file to customize rules
- [ ] Add command line utilities
